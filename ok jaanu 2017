00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,917
What a game!

4
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:45,500
Hello, Bantu, where are you?

5
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,791
I am there... almost there.
- I've been waiting for over an hour.

6
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,457
Almost there... Adi
bro... - Late like always.

7
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,000
Come quickie... - Just
5 more minutes... l am there...

8
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,457
Go away! Get out!
- Please just listen to me.

9
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,249
No! Get out! - Listen...

10
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,375
No... just go!
Don't show me your face again!

11
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,166
I will jump... get out! - Look, Tara...

12
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,375
Get out! No!

13
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,916
Okay, I am going! I am going!

14
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,292
Get out or I will jump. - Relax!

15
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:12,957
I am going. - I will jump!

16
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,458
I wasn't spying on you.

17
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,083
Go. - I am going.

18
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:21,125
I don't care. Go to hell!
- You go to hell!

19
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,417
Hey dumb*** get back.

20
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,333
Can't you see the train? Get back!

21
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,125
Call him, Bantu... where is he?
- It's not reachable.

22
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,624
<i>Ad“ - Bro...</i>

23
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,166
Bro, where were you?
- Love you, buddy.

24
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:15,125
Where were you? - Bantu, I saw
a dream on the train... and got inspired.

25
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,292
When I got off,
I saw reality... which made me perspire.

26
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,417
What are you talking?

27
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,332
Let's go now,
bro... or Jenny here might expire.

28
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,958
Why will Jenny expire?

29
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,916
She's getting married. - Huh?

30
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:28,583
Yeah... Come, I'll tell you. - Marriage?

31
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:29,875
Yeah, marriage.

32
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,207
Actually you should
get married, Jenny...

33
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,332
...it's already too late for you.
- Shut up!

34
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,125
Right, Bantu? - Adi Bro...

35
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,708
We need to stay away from marriage
permanently. - No chance, bro.

36
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,416
Like me... simple, good looking and lean.

37
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:43,167
And me... cheap... smart and single.

38
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:47,042
Forever... and ever and ever and ever...

39
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,083
Stop it, guys.

40
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,541
We're are... at 'Teen Bhavan'.
- But it's just one.

41
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,041
Adi, you're single as well.

42
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,999
Jenny, get the luggage
and escort the guest.

43
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,667
I am getting married,
you get the luggage.

44
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,542
Hello Charu aunty, what's up?

45
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,042
Aunty, it's me... Bantu.

46
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,458
Remember I took you to Maratha
Mandir (Movie Hall) last week.

47
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,958
For DDLJ.

48
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,833
Hello, aunty.

49
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,667
Hi, aunty. - Who are you?

50
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,583
<i>Ac“ .</i>

51
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,457
I am Ravi Gunjal's younger brother...

52
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,167
...who was Gopi uncle's junior. Adi!

53
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,583
Uncle.

54
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:44,917
Hi, Uncle.

55
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:48,333
<i>Ac“ .</i>

56
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,625
What's this? - My hand!

57
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:55,875
Sorry.

58
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,833
Was the train late? - No.

59
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:03,375
Then? - Nothing...

60
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,458
This 'Nothing' won't be
tolerated around here.

61
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,167
Yes.

62
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:12,374
You have to be punctual,
this is a not a hotel.

63
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,958
It's a house, and you're a guest.

64
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,958
Just like all of us... - Yes, I know!

65
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,708
Brother told me everything.

66
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,583
Told you what?
- That Judge sir is a strict man.

67
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,333
He calls you Judge sir.
- Good.

68
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,625
And no late nights...

69
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:31,916
And definitely no
screaming and shouting!

70
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,666
Except for... - Except for?

71
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:36,457
When my wife's singing. - Of course...

72
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,957
Charulata Devi.

73
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,749
The Great Indian Classical Artist.

74
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,000
Sorry... Singer.

75
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,792
Hello... you can't play
cheesy Bollywood numbers here.

76
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,374
You don't know about uncle.

77
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,542
He's a butcher!

78
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:50,625
Sorry uncle... Judge sir... Sorry!

79
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,208
Wrong adjective...

80
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,666
Death penalty hasn't
been abolished in India yet.

81
00:09:56,667 --> 00:10:00,542
I can't decide whether to
throw you two out... or strangle you.

82
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:02,542
How about you don't do either, uncle?

83
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,083
Please pardon us as per section 102.

84
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,208
Thank you, sir.

85
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,749
Sir, please forgive this girl as well.

86
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,917
She's getting married. - Why?

87
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,000
Didn't papa tell you, uncle?

88
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,166
Actually, it's a good
thing to get married early.

89
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:24,166
You can grow old together. - Yeah.

90
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,625
This is your room. - Okay.

91
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,875
Thank you, sir. - Thank you, uncle.

92
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,125
Whoa!

93
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:47,124
Bro, you've no idea
what a grouch the boss is.

94
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,042
I think we should run. - Okay.

95
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:53,500
Hey... you fools... come here.

96
00:10:56,125 --> 00:11:01,083
Boys... the LA guys rejected
all your gaming programs.

97
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,624
I don't have much
knowledge about games.

98
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,457
I am an advertising guy.

99
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,042
Dude... sell it. - What?

100
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,833
The dream you had... sell it.
- Are you mad?

101
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,166
Buddy, first impression
is the last impression.

102
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:14,374
Sell it... come on...

103
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,625
...I will make things
hell for all you, promise.

104
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,542
Sir, we do have an idea. Come on.

105
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,708
Who is this? - Hi, sir.

106
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,749
I am Adi... First day,
first show... first idea.

107
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:32,042
It better be a good idea,
otherwise it will be your last idea.

108
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:33,750
Thank you, sir.

109
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,083
Okay"-...

110
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:40,041
So this game is a thriller,
and it's called 'Mumbai 2.0'.

111
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:42,167
Wow... what a title.

112
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:44,666
What a title.

113
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,791
There's a Boss... sitting
inside Mumbai's local...

114
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,542
The main villain of our game.

115
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,208
This Boss has two heads.

116
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,708
One head is from streets of Mumbai,
like a local gangster.

117
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,582
And the other... classy and dangerous...

118
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,292
...chugging smoke from his cigar!

119
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:04,374
The Boss has a remote... and
the 'Heroine' in captivity.

120
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,082
Bravo... go on...

121
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:06,958
Yes, sir... okay.

122
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,958
In comes our 'Hero'.

123
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,042
Simple looking but deadly fighting.

124
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,458
The 'Hero' must use
sonic-jumps and parkour...

125
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,957
...through buildings and slums...

126
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:21,124
...and clear different levels of bomb-blasts,
car-chase, bike rides, train rides...

127
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:25,791
...and get to the main Villain...
finish him... get the remote.

128
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:27,875
And save the 'Heroine'.

129
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,582
That's Mumbai 2.0.

130
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,042
Wow... amazing.

131
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,917
Great...

132
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,917
What an idea?

133
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,000
How soon can you give it?

134
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,042
Sir... the 3D trailer will
take at least 4 months.

135
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:43,542
4 months?

136
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,792
Take 5...

137
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,083
Thank you, sir.

138
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Jenny.

139
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:01,833
Jenny! - I am really scared.

140
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,167
You can be scared all you want...

141
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:04,375
...later, it will be
his turn to be scared.

142
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:35,708
Dearly beloved, we've come
together in presence of God...

143
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,208
...to witness and bless the joining of
Henry and Jenifer in holy matrimony.

144
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:48,750
The union of husband
and wife is intended by God.

145
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:55,583
For the mutual joy, for the health
and comfort given to each other...

146
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,167
...in prosperity and adversity.

147
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,667
Who gives this woman
to be married to this man?

148
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,458
She gives herself, father.

149
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,417
Of course,
with blessings of mother and father.

150
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,333
In the name of God,
do you Jenifer Rodriguez...

151
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,458
Name?

152
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,333
Tara.

153
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:22,792
<i>Ad“.!</i>

154
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,375
...until death do you apart?

155
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,250
Yes, I do.

156
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:17,167
...as your lawfully wedded wife,
until death do you apart?

157
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,042
I do.

158
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,583
Hey... - Hey-

159
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,042
What did you call me
at the station that day?

160
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,333
Was it darling?

161
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,292
No, what you called
me in a fit of rage.

162
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,875
Mo... - Madam... I called you madam.

163
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:57,250
There's no 'f' in madam.

164
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:01,000
It's hard to realize what
you're saying in a fit of rage.

165
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:02,917
I see...

166
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:11,333
Are you from Jenny's side?
- Hmmm... college friend.

167
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,250
She's looking gorgeous... and happy too.

168
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:19,000
Everything feels
nice in the beginning.

169
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,458
Love-filled days.

170
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:29,792
Marriage... Honeymoon.

171
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,583
Hugs... kisses.

172
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:38,208
Love... - Lust!

173
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,958
Now please exchange the rings,
as the symbol of your love.

174
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:46,542
And then... - Then?

175
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,708
Petty quarrels. - Hmmmm...

176
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,833
Embarrassing your wife
in front of your friends.

177
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,292
And facing the music at home.

178
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:58,042
And then, the kids.

179
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,042
Oh God!

180
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:01,917
Cry-babies.

181
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:05,792
Pukes...

182
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,042
Shit...

183
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,750
Then?

184
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:21,750
And then... their admission.

185
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,458
Turning that dumb*** into a smart***

186
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,458
And when that smart*** grows up...

187
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,875
...watch him get married.

188
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,042
And go through that same
old mess all over again.

189
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,750
Correct. - Correct.

190
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,792
Now, you may kiss the bride.

191
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,875
Hey... - Hey-H

192
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,417
You seem to know a
lot about this department.

193
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:55,792
Are you married?

194
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,750
No. And I never want to.

195
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:02,292
Good! Marriage is for fools.
- Correct!

196
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,250
So just girlfriends, huh?

197
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,625
Around 15... - Not bad.

198
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
And you...

199
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,292
I am going to Paris. - Why?

200
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,708
To study architecture.

201
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,582
Cool. - Thank you.

202
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,417
And you.

203
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,167
I am going to the US...

204
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:24,458
...to give Zuckerburg
a run for his money.

205
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,625
Not bad. - Yeah.

206
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,042
All the best. - Same to you.

207
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,833
Come on... come on... - Come on.

208
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,542
Hey Bantu... come on.

209
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,792
Good morning.

210
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,792
Good morning.
- Morning.

211
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,458
What are you doing here?

212
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,417
It's Peru.

213
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,125
It's an easy one.

214
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,208
You come late at night...
and always in a hurry in the morning.

215
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,417
It was Jenny's wedding party.

216
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,250
Poor thing got hitched.

217
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,583
No partying today, uncle.
I'll come home early today.

218
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,583
What time?
- By 5 'clock.

219
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,333
Put it back... put it...

220
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,458
Actually by 5:30.

221
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,042
Uncle, I'll... be back by 6.
- Yeah.

222
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:21,125
Be back by 6, right.

223
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,582
You've to take Charu
to Ravindra Natya Mandir.

224
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,125
For a classical music program.

225
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:27,708
Me?

226
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,542
Your brother wouldn't
have asked twice.

227
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,708
I've to head to the BSES office...
regarding the electricity bill.

228
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,833
They send such absurd bills.

229
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:44,750
Grease their palms...
and they will never call again.

230
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,374
Do what? - Grease their palms...
fill their pockets.

231
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,083
I see... how about a pour a can
of oil on their hands... their pockets?

232
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,042
Your generation cannot
do without corruption.

233
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,083
I can still handout sentences.

234
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,083
I will throw you out along with
your luggage if you say that again.

235
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,708
Okay uncle, sorry.

236
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,250
Here you are, baby.

237
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,333
Bye.

238
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,042
Bye, aunt!

239
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,499
Here you go, and...
you've almost finished the crossword.

240
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,292
Wow...
- Isn't that amazing.

241
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:24,167
Come, madam.

242
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,042
Hello. Hello.

243
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,708
Hello.

244
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:31,833
Hello. Hello.

245
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,000
Bless you.

246
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:36,958
Hello. Hello.
- Hello.

247
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,583
Hello.

248
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,750
Aunty, you sit and I'll be...
- No-no... sit.

249
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,250
Hello. Hello.

250
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,207
Can you go to that side?
There's another seat.

251
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:47,958
Thank you.

252
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,875
Hello. Hello.

253
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,250
You're a big star, aunty.
- Of course.

254
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,625
You sing so well...
why don't you do a stage show?

255
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,542
You're unmusical and unmelodious.

256
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,208
Uncultured fellow.

257
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:54,958
Get out.

258
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,499
Get down.
- What happened?

259
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,042
I said get down.
- What happened?

260
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,458
Get out! Get down!

261
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,000
Get down from the bus!
- The bus...

262
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,958
You were sleeping through the program.

263
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:11,292
Oh, God!

264
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:22,583
Hello, baby.

265
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:23,917
You're back.
- Yeah.

266
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:25,833
How...

267
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,750
So... how was your program?
- Amazing!

268
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,458
Where are your feet, sir?
- Where they should be.

269
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,042
There's food inside.
Go and eat.

270
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:47,708
Hats off.

271
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,875
Roll up my sleeves... please.

272
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,250
This one too.

273
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,917
Keep these there.

274
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,542
Gopi, should I heat-up the food?

275
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:15,750
We already ate, baby.

276
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,083
Look, I even wiped
my hands with your dress.

277
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,292
Fine, clean this wok properly.

278
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,333
Alzheimer's, 2nd stage.

279
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,582
She's forgotten a great deal.

280
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,042
But she still remembers some things.

281
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,667
Brother Ravi did tell me about it.

282
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,250
How do you handle all this, uncle?

283
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:04,125
Well... if she calls me
Paplu even once in a day...

284
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:08,042
...it fills me up with
the energy for a lifetime.

285
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,083
Paplu...

286
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,125
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

287
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,999
Come-come-come...
let's take you to the bedroom...

288
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,167
...and sing you a lullaby.

289
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,708
Which one is it?
Your favorite lullaby?

290
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,292
Have you open Bank account.

291
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,167
Yes, brother... l did get one.
- Where?

292
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:36,167
At the Parel Branch.

293
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,332
Did Bantu give you the bike?

294
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,833
Madam's geyser isn't working,
I came for some hot water.

295
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:44,667
Yeah... Bantu gave me the bike.

296
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,832
He gave me the bike, the keys,
papers, insurance... everything.

297
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:52,167
I mean... whatever...
wear your helmet while riding.

298
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:54,000
Talk to your sister-in-law.

299
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,041
Hurry up, it's a long-distance call.

300
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:57,416
Hello.
- Quickly.

301
00:24:57,417 --> 00:25:00,041
Hello... - My phone's switching off...
battery's low.

302
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,250
Hello.
- Hello.

303
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:13,500
The number you're trying
to call is currently busy!

304
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:17,917
The number you're trying
to call is currently busy!

305
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,125
Sorry!

306
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:43,000
<i>Hey...
. HEY"</i>

307
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,625
It's me... girlfriend no. 16.

308
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:49,875
I thought its no. 10.

309
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,042
I was just testing your number.

310
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:57,542
Otherwise no decent girl
calls up a guy at this hour.

311
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,750
We'll know your decency when we meet.

312
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:03,500
Whose wedding will we meet next?

313
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:05,750
Jenny's been shipped to America.

314
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,708
Ohh... so you're missing me.

315
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,917
No... l was missing Jenny.

316
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,500
So let's meet...
and miss Jenny together.

317
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,167
Hey...
- What happened?

318
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,167
Anybody there?

319
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:25,250
Ghost... spirit... ghoul... witch!

320
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:30,250
Witch... Girlfriend no. 17.

321
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,125
So when are we meeting?

322
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,583
Tomorrow... coffee at 3!

323
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:44,625
Say yes... say yes-yes.

324
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,167
Maybe.

325
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,625
Good.
- Maybe not.

326
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:54,458
Okay-

327
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:55,917
Okay, bye.

328
00:26:58,542 --> 00:26:59,375
Okay, darling.

329
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,958
We can see right here... check it...
- Tara.

330
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,792
The number you're trying
to call is currently busy.

331
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,957
Busy my foot...
you just hit the jackpot.

332
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,583
Do you know who you're going
to work with on the project?

333
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,208
Shahrukh Khan.

334
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:18,500
One and only... Balakrishna Doshi.

335
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:22,083
Really?
' Really!

336
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:25,375
Come... Baig sir is calling.

337
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:33,583
Hi, sir.

338
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,250
Would you like to work
with Doshi sir on a project?

339
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,667
Of course, sir.
He's the no. 1.

340
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:41,542
I see...

341
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,042
But in the interview
you said that I am no. 1.

342
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,917
You're beyond that...

343
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,167
You're above the list.

344
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:55,417
Anyway, Doshi sir is my hero too.

345
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,582
You'll have to go work
with him in Ahmedabad.

346
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,458
Thank you, sir.

347
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:01,167
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

348
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,417
<i>Hey...
. HEY"</i>

349
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:13,250
Your coffee's turned into cold coffee.

350
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,708
Where are you?

351
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,292
The coffee shop.

352
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:21,417
And I'm done pulling my hair and
using them as noodles in my coffee...

353
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,167
Oh my, what are you doing?

354
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:27,083
Do you know what condition
I am in waiting for you?

355
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,833
But you don't count me as human being.

356
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,833
Since 2:45... I've been
waiting and waiting...

357
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,874
Sorry-sorry-sorry.

358
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:37,957
Stay there, I am coming.

359
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:39,791
I've picked up my bag from the desk.

360
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:42,499
My keys-my keys-I've found my keys.

361
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,042
I have my phone.

362
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:47,124
My boss is looking at me...

363
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,166
He thinks I'm going
out for something urgent.

364
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,999
I just gave him a fake smile...
and faced Asha.

365
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,874
Avoided her by giving
her a cold shoulder.

366
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:56,750
And after dodging
two guys carrying coffee...

367
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,624
My card... my card...

368
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,541
And... open sesame...

369
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,624
I am outside my office.

370
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,666
And I am coming outside
my office walking fast...

371
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:05,917
And you're right in front of me.

372
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,917
You?
- Alak Niranjan lady...

373
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,792
Wow... from desk to door,
somewhere you lost the formalities.

374
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:19,875
You're a funny man.

375
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:21,958
So come let's have fun.

376
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:26,167
What happened?

377
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:31,083
Okay-

378
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,542
1-2-3...

379
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:35,667
Come on.

380
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:36,500
1-2...

381
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,583
So... all time favorite video game.

382
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,417
All time favorite...
No chance.

383
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,083
Definitely not...
- Something...

384
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,625
You tell me...
- My favorite is... Mortal Kombat.

385
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:02,917
I love it.

386
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,333
Tara.

387
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,417
Who is that guy?

388
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:13,583
Isn't that the guy from the train?
- Come on.

389
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,416
At least tell me what
happened between you two.

390
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:19,125
The same thing that didn't happen.

391
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,458
Marriage.

392
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,667
Marriage? You?

393
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,208
<i>Never.</i>

394
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:26,000
He was chasing after me for marriage.

395
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:30,250
And you?
- Me... l was trying to get rid of him.

396
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,250
By jumping in front of the train?

397
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,417
I was just pretending.

398
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,875
To get him out of my life for good.

399
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,750
And that's where I came in.

400
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,792
What?

401
00:30:59,167 --> 00:30:59,958
Tara?

402
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,167
Sorry.

403
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,208
Listen to me. Please.

404
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,583
So...
- So what?

405
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:07,417
See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

406
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:11,833
Where?
- Ahmedabad. Kutch Express.

407
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,958
Hey... when are you coming back?

408
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,042
Don't know.

409
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,292
What are you doing, Paplu?

410
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,958
Tickling you, baby.

411
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,249
Uncle, did you two
always talk like this?

412
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,125
Paplu... baby?

413
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,875
Oh... let it go...

414
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,458
Stupidity of young age...

415
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,250
Tell me, uncle... how did you meet aunty?

416
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:47,792
Well, you see...

417
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,666
I was in my final year of LAW...

418
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,292
...and she was 20 years old.

419
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,999
And I had a taste for classical
music... from the beginning.

420
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But not enough knowledge.
- Like always.

421
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:03,292
Yes, always...

422
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:07,167
And her voice... oh, God.

423
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,332
And her beauty...
- Like always...

424
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:12,833
Yes, always... she was
always so beautiful.

425
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,332
It so happened that
I had a doctor friend...

426
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,708
...and he would tag along as well.

427
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,208
The doctor... was crazy about Charu.

428
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,042
And one day... he sent a
letter to Charu through me.

429
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,042
Love letter.

430
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:31,417
And I gave it to her.

431
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:35,125
She read the letter and smiled.

432
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,667
And when the doctor heard about this,
he grew bolder.

433
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:43,208
He started writing
to her more frequently.

434
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,333
But I never read the envelope.
- I see...

435
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:51,750
I didn't know that he never wrote
his name at the end of the letter.

436
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,750
So tell me... what would I understand?

437
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,833
You thought the letter was from him.
- Of course.

438
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:02,125
And he was also so
good-looking and shy.

439
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,875
Bonjour!

440
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:05,708
That's it...

441
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:08,292
One fine day,
I made him get in my car...

442
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,292
...and took him to see my father.

443
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,541
And uncle, did her father
know you didn't write those letters?

444
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:14,542
No, not at all.

445
00:36:14,543 --> 00:36:16,082
The doctor had already
made one mistake...

446
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,375
...I didn't want to make another one.

447
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,416
And the doctor, didn't he ask?

448
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:26,083
That poor love-stricken
guy... what could he ask?

449
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:30,875
He was a doctor himself.

450
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:36,500
Never miss the train even
if you don't have the ticket.

451
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:08,042
It's not like you think. Ask her.

452
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:14,208
All lies...

453
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:15,875
Why would I lie?

454
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,250
What are you doing?

455
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:28,333
Isn't this train heading to Ahmadabad?

456
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:30,167
I am going to Ahmadabad too.

457
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,667
It's been really long
since I last went there.

458
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,250
Be serious.
- What? Sight-seeing.

459
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,333
I should've known.

460
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,875
Do you do this often?
- What? Sightseeing?

461
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:48,458
No... chasing girls.
- Oh... Since childhood.

462
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,458
How many have you chased till now?

463
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,208
I've lost count.

464
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:57,375
But you said 15.

465
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:06,875
I think there's none.
- I see...

466
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:09,292
Show me your ticket.

467
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,000
I would've missed my train
if I had waited to buy a ticket..

468
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,250
What if you get caught?

469
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:17,042
So be it.

470
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:21,417
Come inside.

471
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:24,333
Stay here.

472
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:28,458
Everyone else is inside.
- So?

473
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,042
They will come looking for me.

474
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,417
Let them.

475
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:40,875
Okay... let them.

476
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,792
You know architecture
is a challenging job.

477
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,125
It's not just a miracle,
but it's a challenge.

478
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,042
And I had to do it for Husain.

479
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,250
What was the old man saying?

480
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:36,582
He was saying architecture
is a mission, a commitment...

481
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,917
...don't get influenced by some
video-gamer and forget your mission.

482
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:43,250
That's a big thing to say.

483
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:46,166
But even the heart has a mission.

484
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,708
One should always
keep the heart in check.

485
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:50,083
Hey...

486
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,417
Hey...

487
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:10,625
What are you drawing?
Is it a sketch of me?

488
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,041
I am making a well.

489
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,000
Why?
- So you can drown in it.

490
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:18,333
Ohh... but your eyes
are perfect for that.

491
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,458
We didn't need such a deep well.

492
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:28,792
True architecture is magical.
It's like magic.

493
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:34,208
It creates fiction... it
creates unexpected spaces.

494
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:39,167
And it... helps to create
unexpected dialogue.

495
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:44,958
It is a generator of passion,
love, romance...

496
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,958
My papa would often come here.
- I see...

497
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:18,792
Does he still come here?

498
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,625
Don't know.
- If he does, don't get me beaten up.

499
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:27,375
He wouldn't recognize me either.

500
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,542
Why?

501
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,958
It's been many years
since he separated from us.

502
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,375
Daily quarrels...

503
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,667
...and then custody battle.

504
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:56,167
I was only 7 when the court asked
me who I would like to live with.

505
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,000
I didn't want to live with anyone.

506
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,417
Then papa left me for good.

507
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:26,708
That's when I decided
I will never get married.

508
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,583
Isn't it time to get to the station?
<i>_</i> S-kic-k

509
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:54,042
Come on-come on-let's go.

510
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:02,208
Shae

511
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:05,083
What now?

512
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:13,000
Let's get a room.

513
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,917
The two of us?
- Of course.

514
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,332
We won't actually
become a married couple...

515
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,875
...if we write so in the register.

516
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:29,292
Whatevs to that!

517
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:33,083
I still won't sign as Mrs. Adi Gunjal.

518
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,208
Fine, I'll sign as Mr. and Mrs. Tara...

519
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,042
What is it?

520
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,083
Agnihotri.

521
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:43,167
Agnihotri.

522
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,625
Whatevs to that?

523
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,792
Bro... another piece of bread for me.

524
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,625
Mr. and Mrs. Tara Agnihotri.

525
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,958
Honeymoon!
- Yeah.

526
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,667
"How are you... all good, sister-in-law."

527
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,416
"Tell us your name."

528
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:31,625
"Hello, my name is Sheetal.
And I am definitely not sister-in-law."

529
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:33,208
There's just one bed.

530
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:35,208
It's big enough for the two of us.

531
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:39,042
One blanket too.

532
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,041
We can easily fit in it.

533
00:44:42,042 --> 00:44:43,875
"My problem is a bit private."

534
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:46,042
"Okay, I hope you don't have
a problem discussing it publicly."

535
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,667
"I don't have a problem.
- Okay."

536
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:51,499
"I actually I live in a joint family,
I've been married for three years now."

537
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
Hey...

538
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,625
There's just one bucket and one mug.

539
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:05,041
"He's always busy either with
the office work... or the family..."

540
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:06,792
Will you behave like a good boy?

541
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,542
Will you behave like a good girl?

542
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,625
Maybe.

543
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:13,667
"This effort from my side."

544
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:15,250
"Maybe not."

545
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:22,749
"I want some kind of naughtiness
back in our relationship."

546
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,958
"Some kind of spice..."

547
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,874
"Naughtiness... I've a superb
track for you actually..."

548
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:31,500
"...that will tickle to
you and your husband also."

549
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:37,375
"So this song from Badshah,
dedicated to one and only AR Rehman."

550
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:39,625
"Here's the new track."

551
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,666
"So how are you... how's you... how're
you... hope you're having fun."

552
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:45,917
"Who is with me next, sister-in-law."

553
00:48:47,042 --> 00:48:47,917
We're here.

554
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:49,208
Let's go.

555
00:48:49,209 --> 00:48:51,125
Wait for me, dude
- Okay.

556
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:09,500
Say that this was your best holiday.

557
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,417
This was my best holiday. Am I right?

558
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,792
Liar. You don't mean that.

559
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,125
Be honest.

560
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:20,208
Honestly?

561
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,167
No-no-no... don't say it.

562
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,417
Okay darling.

563
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:30,708
Am I your darling?
- Yes, darling.

564
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:40,000
Can I go?

565
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:45,625
Say it... Okay darling, go.

566
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:48,375
Not okay darling, don't go.

567
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:50,083
Don't go.

568
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:16,500
Grandpa!

569
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:18,792
My darling...
- Grandpa.

570
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,083
Don't cancel... yes...
- How are you? - Fit and fine.

571
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:26,917
Tara.
- I'll just call you back. Yeah.

572
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:29,125
Shall I? Okay...

573
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:33,208
Your favorite pickle...
with extra oil.

574
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:36,792
Let me say hi to mom.

575
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:40,125
Hi, dear.
- Hi, mom.

576
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,958
Let's go inside and talk.

577
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:50,958
Tara, this is for you.

578
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:55,625
Thanks, mom.

579
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:03,500
Where were you?

580
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,208
I went to Ahmadabad... with
my office colleagues.

581
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:08,375
When did you arrive?

582
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,917
But your office colleagues
returned yesterday.

583
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:13,750
And you... where were you?

584
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,208
I just told you, Ahmadabad.

585
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:21,125
With whom?

586
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:23,208
And what were you doing?

587
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:29,417
Why do you always
ask so many questions?

588
00:51:30,917 --> 00:51:34,833
Because you're my only
daughter... and I worry for you.

589
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:38,083
If I wasn't your only daughter...

590
00:51:38,084 --> 00:51:39,458
...would you have worried
any less for me?

591
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:41,917
Stop this nonsense, Tara.

592
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,750
None of your office colleagues
knew where you were.

593
00:51:47,292 --> 00:51:48,083
And with whom?

594
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:52,542
I went to Sabarmati... with a friend.

595
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:54,708
And missed my train.

596
00:51:58,125 --> 00:51:59,000
Why did you 90'?

597
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,417
To meet Bapu...

598
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:12,250
I used to call him papa...

599
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:14,750
He was your husband.

600
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,625
You know he often went there.

601
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:31,208
Are you going to stay in
Mumbai for business or go back?

602
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,208
I've to go to the office, mom.

603
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:47,208
Why didn't you come
back with us in the train?

604
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,582
I couldn't make it on time,
missed the train.

605
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,292
Where were you?
- And with whom?

606
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:57,333
Sabarmati.
- Why?

607
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:03,625
To meet Bapu.
- So did you meet him?

608
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,042
Yes, I did.
- What was he doing?

609
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:08,167
Spinning his spinning-wheel.

610
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,624
Did you say something?
- Yes, he did.

611
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,375
He said "Sing for me".
- So?

612
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,875
I did?
- What did you sing?

613
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:17,833
Do you want to hear?
- Please do.

614
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,250
Love my foot...

615
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:35,041
...since when did Bapu
start wearing jeans and t-shirt?

616
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:37,999
Oh, God. Ladies, we've work to do.

617
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,500
A presentation to be made, please.

618
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:47,708
<i>Ad“
- Tara!</i>

619
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:50,916
Tell your boss that you've a headache.

620
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:51,833
Take the day off and come with me.

621
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:54,583
Are you mad?

622
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,250
I couldn't sleep all night.
- Me neither.

623
00:54:22,417 --> 00:54:23,750
My hands are still shaking, look.

624
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,125
Stop it.
- Stop what?

625
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,792
Stop... this madness.

626
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:41,417
I can't... what to do.

627
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:44,208
<i>Ad“.!</i>

628
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:51,667
Is this love?

629
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,083
You won't say that, will you?

630
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:00,375
No!

631
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:02,625
I want ice-cream.

632
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,000
Ice-cream?

633
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:08,083
Now?

634
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:29,042
So...
- So?

635
00:55:31,042 --> 00:55:32,208
Should I call mom tomorrow.

636
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:34,875
What for?

637
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:36,625
So she can meet you.

638
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:39,042
Why me?

639
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,417
Our family must be there.

640
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:47,833
Why our family?

641
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:55,750
<i>For our engagement, Ac“.</i>

642
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,750
What the...

643
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,500
Where are we going?

644
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,333
To your hostel.

645
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,958
Hostel? Why?

646
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:49,542
I am taking you to
your hostel before I stray?

647
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:53,750
What if you still do?

648
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,417
Then I will take you in my arms.

649
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,833
What then?

650
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,500
I won't let go.

651
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,333
Then?

652
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:14,125
Kiss you really hard.

653
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:20,875
And After kissing me hard?

654
00:57:22,042 --> 00:57:23,208
Keep kissing you.

655
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:28,792
What then?

656
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,167
What now?

657
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:04,917
Now you will pull me inside your room.

658
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:12,250
And...

659
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,083
Close the door!

660
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:19,208
And after closing the door?

661
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:24,375
I don't know... why don't
you take over from there!

662
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,583
I will eat you up... alive!

663
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:38,042
'I will pull up the curtains...'

664
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:43,667
'...clinch the rains and
hold on to the sky tight.'

665
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,458
'And hide in your arms.'

666
00:59:19,917 --> 00:59:23,250
Do you like me?
- Hmmmm...

667
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:26,250
But I can't say the
same for this hostel room.

668
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:31,917
Do you like me or this?

669
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,083
Of course this.

670
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,083
This is how much I like you.

671
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:39,708
Good.

672
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:41,792
That much is better.

673
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:51,292
Is it right what we're doing?

674
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,542
It's a grave sin.

675
00:59:54,417 --> 00:59:59,125
But... the only way to
atone is to keep doing it.

676
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:07,875
I didn't get it.

677
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:10,208
What did you say?

678
01:00:11,917 --> 01:00:14,417
Uncle, can Tara live here too?

679
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:19,583
Here? Here where?
- In my room.

680
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:21,833
Your room.

681
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:26,292
She's not some milk bottle
you can shelve on the teapoy.

682
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:30,542
And where will you live?
- Even I'll stay on the teapoy.

683
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,708
Sorry... in my room.

684
01:00:34,792 --> 01:00:36,833
Oh, so she's Sitara.

685
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:40,125
Tara... baby, it's Tara.

686
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:41,917
I see...

687
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:43,875
Your room!

688
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:46,458
Together... in the same room?

689
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,833
Together... in the same room!

690
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:53,167
Yes...

691
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,833
Did you two get married?

692
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:57,667
We don't want to get married!

693
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:02,625
So... you two are 'Magliks'.

694
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:06,167
Then you can definitely
marry each other.

695
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:08,792
There's a big problem, aunty.

696
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:11,750
What do you want to say?

697
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,542
Uncle, I am going to Paris...
to become an architect.

698
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:19,417
He's going to America,
to become a millionaire.

699
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:25,917
And... until becomes a millionaire?

700
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:28,167
We want to live together until then.

701
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:30,750
I see...

702
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:34,542
It's one of those...
live-in relationships.

703
01:01:35,542 --> 01:01:37,583
Is it wrong, aunty?
- Absolutely wrong.

704
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,417
Paplu. You're too old fashioned.

705
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:46,417
He signals with his hand even
after turning on the indicator.

706
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:50,000
Look, this is absolutely wrong...

707
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,542
...and it's heading in
the wrong direction. - Uncle...

708
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,958
I won't allow this in my house.
- Listen to me.

709
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:58,708
Listen to me.

710
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:13,625
Uncle, Tara and I are friends.

711
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:14,958
We like each other.

712
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,082
Would it look nice if we met outside...

713
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:18,833
...in a hotel or other shady places?

714
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:22,708
Or live here decently,
with your permission and blessings.

715
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,917
Did you take your brother's blessings?

716
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:26,750
He will kill me.

717
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,667
I see... and I will spare you?

718
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:31,166
Aunty doesn't keep well...

719
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,292
...and you take care of her alone.

720
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:34,292
We can help you.

721
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,416
Even aunty won't feel bored.

722
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:39,208
Look, this is my final decision.

723
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:41,791
And I am saying this
on Charu's behalf too.

724
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:43,416
This is my final decision.
- Uncle...

725
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:46,875
There's no room for argument now.
- Don't be unreasonable, uncle.

726
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:30,708
Great.

727
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:03,958
This is our garden.

728
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:08,250
And our room is on the first floor,
check it out.

729
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,958
And that's uncle and aunt's room,
with full sea-view.

730
01:06:12,292 --> 01:06:14,083
The car's here, these are the flowers.

731
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,833
Hi, aunty.

732
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:21,999
Aunty, this is Bittu and...

733
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,708
And that's Ayesha.
- Hi, aunty.

734
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:25,542
Hello, aunty.

735
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:26,417
You..

736
01:06:26,418 --> 01:06:28,500
That's Bantu.
DDLJ... Maratha Mandir.

737
01:07:02,792 --> 01:07:05,625
Sister-in-law.
- Whose sister-in-law?

738
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:07,250
Hello, sister-in-law. Greetings.

739
01:07:07,251 --> 01:07:09,875
Where are you?
- Absolutely fine, sister-in-law.

740
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:12,624
What's going on?
- What else will I do in the morning?

741
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:13,916
I can hear some strange noises.

742
01:07:13,917 --> 01:07:15,707
No, I was drinking tea...

743
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:17,875
It's hot. - I see...
- Tell her the truth.

744
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:21,708
Yes, How is brother?
- Yeah, he's fine.

745
01:07:21,917 --> 01:07:23,792
And Tia?
- Tia's fine too.

746
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:26,624
Who is Tia?
- Here, talk to your brother.

747
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:27,583
Hello.
- Hello, Adi...

748
01:07:27,584 --> 01:07:29,166
Yes brother... Yeah... greetings.

749
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:30,583
Listen...
- I am listening.

750
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,083
Please explain your
address to this taxi driver.

751
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,292
Address? Taxi-driver? Why?

752
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,000
So we can come there.

753
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,958
Where are you?
- On the way.

754
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,250
Mumbai?
- We're coming to meet you.

755
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:43,708
Coming here?

756
01:07:43,709 --> 01:07:45,125
Talk to him.
- Yeah...

757
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:47,375
Driver...

758
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:49,791
Yeah... do you understand Marathi?
- I am from UP.

759
01:07:49,792 --> 01:07:50,792
Oh, so you're from UP as well.

760
01:07:50,793 --> 01:07:54,125
Look... do you know Malabar Hills,
Hanging Gardens.

761
01:07:55,792 --> 01:07:56,958
You're at Hanging Garden.

762
01:07:57,542 --> 01:08:00,417
We're dead... it's the end.
- Who's dead?

763
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:02,292
We are, who else?

764
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:04,375
I am not dead

765
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:06,125
Would you like me to make
some arrangements for you?

766
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,207
Get up, Tara... please, get up.

767
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,166
Brother's in Mumbai for a day,
with the entire family...

768
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:11,000
...to give me a surprise.

769
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:11,917
Get up!

770
01:08:12,542 --> 01:08:15,332
Stupid... why did you give
him the right directions?

771
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:16,457
You could've given
him a different route.

772
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:17,458
I could've slept little longer.

773
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,708
Brother's here.
- So what now?

774
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:25,750
Where will you go?
- Me... Nowhere.

775
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:28,375
Nowhere?

776
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,167
What will we do when brother
and sister-in-law come here?

777
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:34,166
I'll say "Greetings, I am Tara".

778
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:37,041
"And I am living-in with Adi-Adi-Adi."

779
01:08:37,042 --> 01:08:39,500
Adi-Adi-Adi... Tara, have you gone mad?

780
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:42,333
Please try to understand
the situation... and get up.

781
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:46,875
Hello.
- Greetings, sister-in-law.

782
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:48,042
How many times are
you going to greet her?

783
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:50,624
Listen...
- How far have you reached?

784
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:51,375
We're at the gate.

785
01:08:51,376 --> 01:08:53,333
At the gate? - Yes.
- I am coming, bye.

786
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,708
My dear... dear bubbly...

787
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:58,667
My sweetheart... my baby.

788
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:01,874
Ok darling, listen...
help me out...

789
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:04,375
...or we'll get stuck
in a big drama. Please.

790
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:06,792
We're dead.

791
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:09,250
This witch isn't getting up.

792
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:15,667
I'll get that.
- Okay.

793
01:09:21,292 --> 01:09:23,250
Hello, sir.
- Hi. - Hi.

794
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:25,916
How are you, you fool?
- First class, sister-in-law.

795
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:27,500
Fit and fine...

796
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:29,291
So big man.
- Yeah.

797
01:09:29,292 --> 01:09:31,000
All set to conquer America.
- Yeah, brother!

798
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,250
Tia! You've grown so tall in 10 days.

799
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,124
Shall I make coffee for everyone?

800
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:37,500
Let us come in first,
meet Judge sir.

801
01:09:38,292 --> 01:09:39,917
Hello, Charulata ma'am.

802
01:09:40,292 --> 01:09:41,375
How are you?

803
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,333
Judge sir must be out playing cricket.

804
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:46,208
Who are they, Adi?

805
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,417
This is my brother.

806
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:50,292
He was junior to Gopi uncle...
he lived with you in Lucknow.

807
01:09:50,542 --> 01:09:52,583
And this is my sister-in-law and Tia.
- I see.

808
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:54,708
Where is Paplu?

809
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,542
I think he's out playing cricket?

810
01:09:57,708 --> 01:10:00,750
Paplu? - Gopi uncle.
She calls him fondly.

811
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:03,250
Just like you call brother... Dabbu.

812
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:05,208
What nonsense.

813
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:10,542
Where do you stay?
- Me? I stay right here.

814
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:14,958
His room is upstairs.
- Oh... thank you.

815
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:18,082
Let's go... upstairs. Show me your room. Quickly!
- Now sister-in-law.

816
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:20,457
We'll see it right now.
- It's in a complete mess. - It's okay,

817
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:22,166
lam here to clean up your mess.

818
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:22,917
Come on, show me.
- Sister-in-law.

819
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:24,541
Sister-in-law. Wait, sister-in-law.
- What happened?

820
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:26,125
I've changed.
- Very good.

821
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:28,416
Is this your room?
- No.

822
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:29,125
Okay-

823
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:31,292
Is this? - Sister-in-law,
there's someone in my life.

824
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:35,417
What? Let me see.

825
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:38,583
Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!

826
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:43,875
Saved!

827
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:46,375
Sister-in-law.

828
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:49,542
You really have changed, Adi.

829
01:10:49,792 --> 01:10:52,708
Like I said...
there's a change in my life.

830
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:54,167
I can see that.

831
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:55,667
Hello, Baby.

832
01:10:56,917 --> 01:10:58,916
Who are you?

833
01:10:58,917 --> 01:11:01,457
Tia... keep seated...

834
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:03,041
No need for formalities, baldy.

835
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:04,042
Gunjal, sir.

836
01:11:04,043 --> 01:11:05,417
It's a huge house.
- Yeah.

837
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:08,832
How far is your office?
- Takes me 30 minutes to get there.

01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:11,332
Nice... and how do you go?
- Bantu's bike.

839
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,874
I take the bus or train.

01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,292
Sometimes uncle's car as well.

We'll stay in Adi's room

847
01:11:31,542 --> 01:11:34,125
Yes. You can stay in Adi's room.

848
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:35,542

Okay, now shoot this fellow.

Right from the time he

Thank you.

888
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:05,250
Hi.
- Hi.

889
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,167
Whose room is this?

890
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,125
<i>Ad? s .</i>

891
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:16,833
<i>Ad? s'?</i>

892
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,958
Where do you stay?

893
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:25,000
You see,
Adi's brother is na'l've... not me.

894
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:27,833
I can clearly figure
out what's going on here.

895
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:30,917
Are you two married?
- No.

896
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,333
But you intend to?

897
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:36,125
Right now our focus is our careers.

898
01:14:38,042 --> 01:14:41,625
So you two live here... without marriage.

899
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:46,250
I don't want interfere in your lives.

900
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:50,833
But you see, when two people in love,
live together...

901
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:53,958
...they get habituated to each other.

902
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:57,541
And when the time comes to part ways...

903
01:14:57,542 --> 01:15:00,583
...you can't get over the habit...
or love.

904
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:04,957
And let's assume that...
if you two have to part ways...

905
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:07,042
...for the sake of your careers.

906
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,708
What will choose...
habit or love?

907
01:15:17,417 --> 01:15:18,208
Think about it.

908
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:23,500
And this... is yours.

909
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:26,375
Bye.

910
01:15:30,417 --> 01:15:32,333
Sweeta...

911
01:15:36,167 --> 01:15:42,500
People tend to get...
cheated a lot.

912
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:50,458
Sister-in-law... knows...
what goes in the room.

913
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:57,542
Don't scare me...
you know my heart's weak.

914
01:15:57,708 --> 01:16:04,875
Sister-in-law... must have...
told brother everything.

915
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,708
Tara-Tara-Tara-Tara-Tara!

916
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:12,375
You're crazy, showing up
in front of my entire family.

917
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:14,208
You didn't answer my phone either.

918
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,292
But where are we going?

919
01:16:17,167 --> 01:16:19,542
You said you'll follow me until hell.

920
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:21,000
So why ask questions now?

921
01:16:22,917 --> 01:16:24,083
Fine... but do you have
the address to hell?

922
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,958
Tara! It's a gynecology clinic.

923
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:32,750
What a genius you are.

924
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:34,750
Hi.
- Hi.

925
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,333
Please wait there.

926
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:38,458
Okay-

927
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:41,083
Is this some kind of
test report... for Charu aunty?

928
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:43,125
Shut up!

929
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:55,958
Tara!

930
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:58,750
Everyone here looks pregnant.

931
01:17:00,292 --> 01:17:02,583
They don't just look pregnant,
they are.

932
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,833
Tara.

933
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:13,333
These test reports you brought in...

934
01:17:15,542 --> 01:17:17,208
Is it what I think it is?

935
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:20,167
How do I know what you're thinking?

936
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:25,458
These are your test reports,
and not Charu aunty'

937
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:30,375
Tara, are you pregnant?

938
01:17:33,542 --> 01:17:36,333
How can I be sure without
seeing the test results, Adi?

939
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:46,792
And what if the reports are positive?

940
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:52,333
Maybe...

941
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:55,250
The earth under my feet is shaking.

942
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,500
It's not the earth,
your legs are shaking.

943
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:05,917
But Tara,
we did all the calculations.

944
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:08,750
Excuse me, ma'am...
Dr. Sheriyar is calling you.

945
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:12,833
Tara, wait a minute.

946
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:16,000
Tara, wait...

947
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:28,250
Hi.
- Hi.

948
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:31,125
First child?
- Don't know.

949
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:32,542
Huh?
- Yeah...

950
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:36,167
No wonder you look so nervous.

951
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:39,917
You know... when my husband
brought me here for the first time...

952
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:42,958
...he was saying "The ground
under my feet is shaking".

953
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:45,792
I am sure his legs were shaking,
not the earth.

954
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:47,458
It happens.

955
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:53,333
Listen... bring your wife
here every month for checkup.

956
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:54,708
It's very important.

957
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:58,417
Look at my husband...
never takes time off his work.

958
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:00,417
So I come here on my own... alone.

959
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:04,375
But you must come with her, okay.

960
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,042
You know... it's such a nice feeling...

961
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:12,000
...the little movements
inside the stomach.

962
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:14,542
Feels so nice...

963
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,666
My mind runs astray...

964
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:17,667
Adi...
- Yeah.

965
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:19,625
Let's go.
- Okay.

966
01:19:20,042 --> 01:19:21,500
Dry mango...
- No-no... thank you.

967
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,666
Bye, all the best.
- Bye...

968
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:24,583
Tara...

969
01:19:24,584 --> 01:19:26,208
What happened?
Tell me something.

970
01:19:27,042 --> 01:19:28,625
Positive? Negative?
Tell me something?

971
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:31,000
Any movements inside your stomach?

972
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:33,542
Read it yourself.

973
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,583
Tara...

974
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:43,708
Yeah... - What's this?
Looks like some drawings...

975
01:19:45,917 --> 01:19:47,792
Yeah... it's the floor
plan of the clinic.

976
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,583
Our company is renovating the place.

977
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:52,125
Come on...

978
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:53,417
You're...

979
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:55,458
Come on...

980
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,082
You looked so cute
when you were scared...

981
01:19:58,083 --> 01:19:59,583
Very cute...
- Tara, what is this?

982
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:01,167
Huh!

983
01:20:01,708 --> 01:20:02,625
Come here.

984
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:06,417
What is this?
What is this?

985
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:07,625
Suri...

986
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:08,833
Yes, sir.
- What are you doing?

987
01:20:08,834 --> 01:20:10,542
Your train's jumping around.

988
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,458
Sir, what weapon should I give him?

989
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:16,375
Give him a big gun... you wouldn't
want to give him a slingshot!

990
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:19,917
Sir, how about a bazooka?
- Now you're talking.

991
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,500
Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

992
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:24,208
Sir, the LA producers just called.

993
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:27,750
Tell them to take a flying
jump at a rolling donut.

994
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:29,208
What are you guys up to?

995
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:30,167
Hello, sir.

996
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:31,833
What's going on?

997
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,375
Wow! Who's that guy?

998
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,999
It's the main villain, dude.
- Villain?

999
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:44,750
Yeah.

1000
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:47,292
I've seen him somewhere before.
- Really?

1001
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:50,167
Yes.
- It's you. - Me?

1002
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:52,750
Villain? With two heads.

1003
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,958
What's happening?

1004
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:09,624
Jump...

1005
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:11,125
Jump... go up..

1006
01:21:16,417 --> 01:21:18,667
Kill him. Kill him.

1007
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:25,417
Nice...
- Boss, you're amazing.

1008
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:28,707
Your game's awesome.
- Thank you, sir.

1009
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:31,832
Immediately ship to LA.
- Immediately?

1010
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:33,792
Immediately!
- Done, sir we are ready.

1011
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:40,750
Tara!

1012
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,375
You didn't sleep all night?

1013
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:57,667
Either you're very happy
or very sad?

1014
01:21:58,917 --> 01:22:00,958
People often lose their
sleep in these two conditions.

1015
01:22:04,542 --> 01:22:05,958
It's both.

1016
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,250
I just got an email from Paris.

1017
01:22:13,792 --> 01:22:14,875
I got the admission.

1018
01:22:15,625 --> 01:22:19,124
Wow... so I know why you're happy.

1019
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:20,083
But why the tears?

1020
01:22:22,875 --> 01:22:24,292
Feels like I am leaving
something behind.

1021
01:22:27,417 --> 01:22:28,708
<i>Does Ac“ know'?</i>

1022
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:31,667
No!

1023
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:37,625
Tell me something.

1024
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,333
What's more important for you?

1025
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:47,458
<i>Your career or Ac“?</i>

1026
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:56,124
6 months ago I would've said career.

1027
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:56,917
But now...

1028
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,458
Tara-Tara-Tara!

1029
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:14,333
Tara-Tara-Tara!

1030
01:23:15,083 --> 01:23:16,375
Tara...

1031
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:18,750
Why are you packing our clothes?

1032
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:21,958
Just mine... not yours.

1033
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,042
Tara?

1034
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:27,375
What's wrong?

1035
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:29,250
I am leaving.

1036
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:33,208
But Why?

1037
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:35,458
Hello.

1038
01:23:37,542 --> 01:23:38,417
It's over!

1039
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:45,875
Tara, what happened?

1040
01:23:50,667 --> 01:23:51,750
Only for two days.

1041
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:57,458
S*** man... you witch...

1042
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:00,917
You're such a drama queen.

1043
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:03,833
It's not my fault that
you always fall for it.

1044
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:07,874
Thank God... l thought you
found out about Anjali and Zoya...

1045
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:10,083
...and you're leaving me.
- Shut up!

1046
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:11,125
Shut up...

1047
01:24:12,542 --> 01:24:15,792
Who are you going with?
- Mr. Doshi.

1048
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,375
I don't like this Mr. Doshi, you know.

1049
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:20,124
What is your problem
with a 80 year old man?

1050
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:21,750
Old men like him are perverts too.

1051
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:24,250
Come here.

1052
01:24:25,542 --> 01:24:26,458
Stay for a while.

1053
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:28,167
I am getting late.

1054
01:24:28,168 --> 01:24:30,000
What late?
You're not allowed to go.

1055
01:24:30,667 --> 01:24:31,500
Now allowed.

1056
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:35,958
Look... we already made it clear.
- What?

1057
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:38,083
No asserting rights.

1058
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:40,708
I see...

1059
01:24:41,792 --> 01:24:45,458
Save it for your wife.
- Wife? No thank you.

1060
01:24:46,417 --> 01:24:47,333
Fine, go.

1061
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,833
Bye, Tara. Hi, Anjali.

1062
01:24:50,042 --> 01:24:51,333
Yeah, Anjali.
What's the plan?

1063
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:53,625
Bye, darling. Have fun!

1064
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:57,875
Darling my foot...

1065
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:58,583
Wait.

1066
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,917
Adi. Adi. Adi.

1067
01:29:00,167 --> 01:29:03,875
Darling... where are you?

1068
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:07,292
<i>Ad“.!</i>

1069
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,417
Hi, guys.
- Hello, dear.

1070
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:27,333
Where's Adi?
His phone switched off as well.

1071
01:29:27,667 --> 01:29:29,208
Didn't Adi go with you?

1072
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,792
He's sleeping in his room.

1073
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:36,167
I am really scared of this boy.

1074
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:38,833
He wants perfection in everything.
- What Perfection?

1075
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,333
His game... on the Underworld.

1076
01:29:41,792 --> 01:29:45,458
He goes to really dangerous
places for research...

1077
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:47,750
I am really scared, man.

1078
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:50,125
Still can't get through him.

1079
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:48,083
Look, Adi will come
back sooner or later.

1080
01:30:48,583 --> 01:30:50,833
But don't chase him
around like a wife.

1081
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:52,708
I am not chasing him.

1082
01:30:53,083 --> 01:30:55,833
But he should at least tell me...

1083
01:30:59,292 --> 01:31:00,375
Adi?
- Hello.

1084
01:31:01,542 --> 01:31:03,542
Are you at the office?
- Where are you?

1085
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,458
I am waiting for you.

1086
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,875
Just come out of your office.

1087
01:31:09,417 --> 01:31:12,333
Hello.
- Just wait there, I am coming.

1088
01:31:13,292 --> 01:31:16,417
Where are you?
- Just keep walking straight.

1089
01:31:16,667 --> 01:31:19,708
Where?
- You sound so sexy in that angry tone!

1090
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:23,500
Just let me get my hands
on you... l will shoot you.

1091
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,250
How about a sword instead?

1092
01:31:35,875 --> 01:31:37,583
You'll need a license to shoot me.

1093
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:39,667
Where were you?

1094
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,167
And why call me here?

1095
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:43,916
It's an expensive restaurant.

1096
01:31:43,917 --> 01:31:45,833
I thought,
maybe you won't make a scene here.

1097
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,417
Answer me.
- Would you like to eat?

1098
01:31:53,792 --> 01:31:54,625
I want to eat you.

1099
01:31:55,833 --> 01:31:57,041
No possible. Today is Tuesday.

1100
01:31:57,042 --> 01:31:58,792
And you don't eat meat on Tuesdays.

1101
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:02,417
Why don't you just
tell me where you were?

1102
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:08,708
Don't you care about what
I've been through in the last 2 days?

1103
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:15,707
Don't you think... it's
your responsibility...

1104
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:17,667
...to tell me where you were.

1105
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:21,333
Remember... your last
words before you left.

1106
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:24,292
No asserting rights!

1107
01:32:26,417 --> 01:32:28,792
So this is revenge?
- No...

1108
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:32,167
You could've kept your phone on.

1109
01:32:33,042 --> 01:32:34,375
How could I? I was in Kanpur.

1110
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:38,833
Mom?

1111
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:42,292
Yeah... why else would I go there?

1112
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:44,333
Did you go there on your own?

1113
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:46,167
I had no plans of going there.

1114
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,167
Look, I am a middle-class guy.

1115
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:52,542
So when your private plane
came to pick me up, I obliged.

1116
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:54,208
You weren't here either.

1117
01:32:54,417 --> 01:32:56,292
So I thought I'll do
some sightseeing in Kanpur.

1118
01:32:57,292 --> 01:32:58,250
What did she say?

1119
01:32:59,208 --> 01:33:02,833
She wanted to know why
I have been chasing you around.

1120
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:07,833
She already knew who and what I am.

1121
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:12,458
Then?
- Then... l told her.

1122
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:15,208
"Your Tara made me
see stars in daylight."

1123
01:33:17,167 --> 01:33:17,917
Then?

1124
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:22,917
Then she asked... "What
made you move in with me"?

1125
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:27,125
What did you say?

1126
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:30,125
I said "I don't know...
I'll go ask her" and left.

1127
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:35,375
So... what did you see in me, Tara?

1128
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:46,375
Hey, that's Vodka.

1129
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:52,458
Excuse me, sir... your check.
- Tara...

1130
01:33:53,625 --> 01:33:55,042
Oh, man!
- Tara.

1131
01:33:56,167 --> 01:33:57,167
Tara, listen to me.

1132
01:33:57,168 --> 01:33:59,667
Don't talk to me!
- What else should I do?

1133
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,457
I can't divorce you,
because I've no right over you.

1134
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:05,083
Divorce. Divorce. Divorce.
Don't show me your face for two days.

1135
01:34:05,458 --> 01:34:06,375
Just two days?

1136
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:10,958
Come here.

1137
01:34:11,875 --> 01:34:12,750
Come here.

1138
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:16,958
First selfie of our first fight.

1139
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:18,375
I am uploading this.

1140
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:10,333
Taxi.

1141
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:13,583
Let's go quickly.

1142
01:35:17,667 --> 01:35:18,583
Tara.

1143
01:35:20,958 --> 01:35:22,958
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Hey man, do you have a death-wish?

1144
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:24,874
Follow that car, please.
- Why?

1145
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:27,500
Love, huh?
- Follow her.

1146
01:35:43,083 --> 01:35:43,875
Stop.

1147
01:35:48,917 --> 01:35:51,542
Madam, my fare? - Take your fare
from that blue T-Shirt boy.

1148
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,250
Sir... - What?
- My fare.

1149
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:04,250
Come on.
- Where?

1150
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:08,292
Right there.
- Who? The Big Guy!

1151
01:37:09,417 --> 01:37:11,250
We're not on good terms these days.

1152
01:37:15,583 --> 01:37:16,625
Let's go make an offering.

1153
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:18,917
I prayed for your safe return.

1154
01:37:37,375 --> 01:37:38,208
Charu Aunty!

1155
01:37:40,417 --> 01:37:41,916
Adi.
- Charu Aunty!

1156
01:37:41,917 --> 01:37:43,333
I...
- What are you doing here?

1157
01:37:45,083 --> 01:37:45,958
'III

1158
01:37:47,042 --> 01:37:48,083
Get up... come on...

1159
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:49,375
Come on...

1160
01:37:50,917 --> 01:37:54,208
I was...
- Where were you going?

1161
01:37:56,458 --> 01:37:57,583
I forgot.

1162
01:37:58,458 --> 01:37:59,917
Come.
- Come, let's go home.

1163
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:29,583
It's the next stage of Alzheimer's.

1164
01:38:54,083 --> 01:38:56,541
What did the doctor say?
- The doctor said...

1165
01:38:56,542 --> 01:38:59,458
...you're in much better
condition than before.

1166
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:01,708
Don't lie to me, Paplu.

1167
01:39:03,958 --> 01:39:07,333
I can hear noises in my head all day.

1168
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:09,417
I am forgetting everything.

1169
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:12,208
People... places... everything.

1170
01:39:12,792 --> 01:39:17,625
Even my music seems to be leaving me...
- No-no... that's not possible.

1171
01:39:18,792 --> 01:39:23,457
Fine, so what the doctor
say... while giving you the medicines.

1172
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:27,292
I am losing my memory... not my mind.

1173
01:39:27,542 --> 01:39:30,792
Docter told to take medicine
after reaching home.

1174
01:39:33,417 --> 01:39:34,208
Paplu...

1175
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:40,167
...what if I forget you someday?

1176
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:46,750
What will you do?

1177
01:40:18,667 --> 01:40:20,582
What's going on, mama?

1178
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:23,208
Hello.
- Hello... who do you want to meet?

1179
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:27,167
Ravi Gunjal.
- l... l am Ravi Gunjal.

1180
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:30,542
I see... Sit. I am Tara's mom.

1181
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:32,667
Sit.

1182
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,124
Idiot... why do you always
create problems for me?

1183
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:40,333
Good evening guys.
- What did I do now?

1184
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:43,000
Well, there's one right here... now.

1185
01:40:44,667 --> 01:40:45,542
Take a look...

1186
01:40:49,042 --> 01:40:50,917
What is all this?

1187
01:40:54,292 --> 01:40:56,042
Who is she? Do you know her?

1188
01:40:56,458 --> 01:40:57,833
Yes, brother. She is Tara's mom.

1189
01:40:59,417 --> 01:41:00,583
And who is Tara?

1190
01:41:02,917 --> 01:41:03,750
Her daughter.

1191
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:06,708
I will slap you out cold.

1192
01:41:08,583 --> 01:41:10,250
I mean Gopi uncle's niece.

1193
01:41:10,458 --> 01:41:11,708
She's living with him.

1194
01:41:11,917 --> 01:41:14,417
No she's not, she lives with you.

1195
01:41:14,667 --> 01:41:15,958
In your room.

1196
01:41:16,417 --> 01:41:18,792
And her mother is sitting
in our living room.

1197
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:22,791
Does Gopi know? - She lives
here with Gopi uncle's consent.

1198
01:41:22,792 --> 01:41:25,375
She is his niece.
- Gopi's lost his mind.

1199
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,042
He doesn't know anything.

1200
01:41:27,417 --> 01:41:31,124
Bloody Ravi Gunjal... if
I've lost my mind...

1201
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:32,958
...why is there hair
growing on your head?

1202
01:41:33,625 --> 01:41:35,833
That baldy's grown hair?

1203
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:39,749
Sir... l didn't know you were there too...

1204
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:40,625
Would you like some sweets?

1205
01:41:40,833 --> 01:41:42,250
Did you forget the
thrashing in Lucknow?

1206
01:41:42,667 --> 01:41:43,542
Would you like some more?

1207
01:41:45,667 --> 01:41:48,208
No, sir... Tara's mom is here.

1208
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:49,958
What do I do? Tell me...

1209
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,291
You fool, you should be thankful that...

1210
01:41:52,292 --> 01:41:54,667
...they came to you.

1211
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:56,541
Sir, she's here with
a marriage proposal...

1212
01:41:56,542 --> 01:41:57,708
She is talking about marriage.

1213
01:41:58,167 --> 01:42:00,291
You won't find another girl like her.

1214
01:42:00,292 --> 01:42:01,083
Get lost.

1215
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,249
Did you show this to the lawyer?
- Yeah ma'am...

1216
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,375
...I've shown it to the lawyer,
but they are not agreeing...

1217
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,582
I am a little busy Tara,
can I call you back?

1218
01:42:16,583 --> 01:42:17,832
No mom, I want to talk right now.

1219
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:18,750
Don't hang up.

1220
01:42:19,125 --> 01:42:20,458
Driver, stop the car please.

1221
01:42:21,917 --> 01:42:23,583
Please excuse me. Take the follow car.

1222
01:42:23,792 --> 01:42:24,875
Yeah, sure ma'am.

1223
01:42:32,458 --> 01:42:33,250
Go ahead, Tara.

1224
01:42:33,251 --> 01:42:35,667
Why are you interfering
in my life, mom. - Manners!

1225
01:42:36,792 --> 01:42:40,000
Who told you to fix my marriage?
- Who's going to tell me?

1226
01:42:40,792 --> 01:42:43,792
Are you going to tell me...
or am I going to tell you to get married?

1227
01:42:44,333 --> 01:42:47,000
You live with a complete
stranger... all alone.

1228
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:48,417
Who else is going to
talk some sense into you?

1229
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,125
He's not a stranger.

1230
01:42:50,583 --> 01:42:51,833
So why don't you marry him?

1231
01:42:52,292 --> 01:42:53,874
Marriage is not my priority.

1232
01:42:53,875 --> 01:42:55,833
You might have been a burden...
- Manners...

1233
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:58,166
Maybe you were a burden
on your family, but not me.

1234
01:42:58,167 --> 01:42:59,333
I can look after myself.

1235
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:02,250
I see... did you grow up on your own?

1236
01:43:02,917 --> 01:43:05,583
That's the most I could've
done for you as your mother.

1237
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:07,499
I proposed marriage on your behalf...

1238
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,000
...to the guy you like.

1239
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,083
Asked for his hand
in marriage... for you.

1240
01:43:11,708 --> 01:43:12,875
Has any mother ever done that?

1241
01:43:13,375 --> 01:43:14,708
No mother has ever
done what you did either.

1242
01:43:14,958 --> 01:43:17,583
Making the police spy on me.

1243
01:43:18,208 --> 01:43:19,917
I was not spying on you, Tara!

1244
01:43:20,250 --> 01:43:22,375
Come on, stop it.
- You shut up!

1245
01:43:22,542 --> 01:43:23,875
Don't forget your manners, Tara!

1246
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:26,500
No, mom...

1247
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:29,417
I wasn't telling you...
- Manners!

1248
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:35,417
Such anger, Tara.

1249
01:43:36,042 --> 01:43:37,375
Stop it now... enough!

1250
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:39,749
Come on, I want to show you something.

1251
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:40,500
Come on...

1252
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:42,208
Come on... Hey...

1253
01:43:46,667 --> 01:43:47,292
Tara...

1254
01:43:48,208 --> 01:43:52,625
Listen... this is it
now... the final verdict.

1255
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:57,917
So stop fuming... and start praying.

1256
01:44:01,917 --> 01:44:02,958
For me, please...

1257
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:11,458
Okay-

1258
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:13,583
Eyes closed.

1259
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:23,583
Where are these guys?

1260
01:44:24,708 --> 01:44:26,292
Sorry-sorry-sorry-sorry...

1261
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:27,208
Hi...

1262
01:44:27,667 --> 01:44:29,333
Adi.
- Okay, rolling.

1263
01:45:52,125 --> 01:45:53,333
Number one.

1264
01:45:53,625 --> 01:45:54,750
<i>Ac“ .</i>

1265
01:45:56,417 --> 01:45:57,875
Three cheers for Adi.

1266
01:45:58,250 --> 01:45:59,750
Hip-hip hurray!

1267
01:46:00,042 --> 01:46:01,457
Hip-hip hurray!

1268
01:46:01,458 --> 01:46:03,333
Hip-hip hurray!

1269
01:46:04,875 --> 01:46:06,292
Dude, you've done it.

1270
01:46:06,958 --> 01:46:09,458
Those LA guys love your game.
- Yeah...

1271
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:13,957
They immediately sent your ticket,
visa... everything. - Oh, sir...

1272
01:46:13,958 --> 01:46:15,917
And in 10 days... you're out of here.

1273
01:46:16,542 --> 01:46:17,958
10 days!

1274
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:21,750
Adi bro...

1275
01:46:22,833 --> 01:46:23,792
Come lets 90..

1276
01:46:23,958 --> 01:46:26,083
Let's party.
Time to open up the bottles...

1277
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:35,624
Jenny... welcome back.
- Thank you.

1278
01:46:35,625 --> 01:46:36,458
Cheers.

1279
01:46:43,917 --> 01:46:45,166
Tara, come please..

1280
01:46:45,167 --> 01:46:46,542
Adi, is going tara.

1281
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:47,999
Tara please.

1282
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,833
My heart's really depressed, Jenny.
- Why?

1283
01:46:51,292 --> 01:46:54,000
Scared of going to America?
- No.

1284
01:46:54,917 --> 01:46:56,208
Scared of leaving her.

1285
01:47:01,167 --> 01:47:02,208
Tara!

1286
01:47:04,458 --> 01:47:05,875
My biggest mistake.

1287
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:13,458
Shall I tell her?
- I will strangle you.

1288
01:47:22,542 --> 01:47:26,792
I must leave this beautiful world,
just to go to America!

1289
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:38,583
Cheers Jenny.

1290
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:01,667
Stop here, please.

1291
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:03,958
What happened?

1292
01:48:08,375 --> 01:48:10,917
What's wrong, Tara?

1293
01:48:15,333 --> 01:48:16,667
How much?
- 150.

1294
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Here... thank you.

1295
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:36,542
When are you going to America?

1296
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:40,625
Will you come along?

1297
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:44,750
Only to see you off.

1298
01:48:47,792 --> 01:48:49,375
Better to part ways right here.

1299
01:48:50,292 --> 01:48:52,167
It'll be much more complicated later.

1300
01:48:53,542 --> 01:48:55,458
Will you go to Paris with me?

1301
01:49:01,583 --> 01:49:04,833
Tell me something... why
are we scaring each other...

1302
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:06,250
...about parting ways?

1303
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:08,875
Because we are scared.

1304
01:49:09,917 --> 01:49:11,083
It's time to part ways.

1305
01:49:14,917 --> 01:49:19,833
Adi. The last 6 months...

1306
01:49:20,958 --> 01:49:22,292
Time just flew by.

1307
01:49:24,583 --> 01:49:26,125
The best days of my life.

1308
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:30,542
Mine too.

1309
01:49:33,625 --> 01:49:34,833
Just 10 more days.

1310
01:49:37,875 --> 01:49:38,957
And then, you'll be off to Paris...

1311
01:49:38,958 --> 01:49:40,000
...and I will be in US.

1312
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:44,917
We will move on in our lives.

1313
01:49:46,792 --> 01:49:48,042
Maybe you will find someone.

1314
01:49:48,875 --> 01:49:50,208
Maybe you will find someone!

1315
01:49:56,917 --> 01:49:59,583
So then... just 10 days, huh!

1316
01:50:07,208 --> 01:50:10,125
Tara... promise me.

1317
01:50:12,667 --> 01:50:16,000
The next 10 days... no
fights or quarrels.

1318
01:50:19,083 --> 01:50:22,333
No emotional talk... no arguments...

1319
01:50:23,958 --> 01:50:25,333
No drama...

1320
01:50:27,375 --> 01:50:28,250
Okay-

1321
01:50:30,083 --> 01:50:32,125
No crying... no sleeping...

1322
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:35,250
Okay-

1323
01:50:37,917 --> 01:50:40,083
Full party... full on fun.

1324
01:50:43,208 --> 01:50:47,458
Let's live an entire
lifetime in these 10 days.

1325
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:50,374
Okay-
. okay-

1326
01:50:50,375 --> 01:50:51,957
Okay-
. okay-

1327
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:55,833
Okay.
- Okay... Darling!

1328
01:51:20,375 --> 01:51:21,917
What if this was our home?

1329
01:51:23,042 --> 01:51:24,667
All the rooms would be our bedrooms

1330
01:51:27,292 --> 01:51:29,792
And a fierce dog.

1331
01:51:30,875 --> 01:51:32,083
Shishupal.

1332
01:51:32,375 --> 01:51:33,458
Shishupal?

1333
01:51:35,667 --> 01:51:37,000
Shishupal!

1334
01:51:39,458 --> 01:51:40,375
And kids?

1335
01:51:42,792 --> 01:51:44,750
We'll adopt a boy for one day.

1336
01:51:48,292 --> 01:51:49,875
And we'll call him Shishupal.

1337
01:51:51,333 --> 01:51:53,458
What if it's a girl?
- Still Shishupal.

1338
01:51:55,042 --> 01:51:56,583
Yeah, baby...

1339
01:51:58,375 --> 01:51:59,333
Come on...

1340
01:52:06,208 --> 01:52:07,958
What will you do in America?

1341
01:52:08,917 --> 01:52:09,792
Go to a strip club.

1342
01:52:10,833 --> 01:52:11,667
Shut up.

1343
01:52:12,208 --> 01:52:14,250
Ask me what I'll do in Paris.

1344
01:52:14,667 --> 01:52:15,583
What will you do?

1345
01:52:16,875 --> 01:52:17,625
Don't know.

1346
01:52:18,417 --> 01:52:21,458
Maybe waste my time
thinking what you're doing.

1347
01:52:22,375 --> 01:52:23,875
But you'll be at the strip club.

1348
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,917
I love you!

1349
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,167
Tick-tock-tick-tock...

1350
01:52:41,125 --> 01:52:42,583
...time's slipping through.

1351
01:52:52,875 --> 01:52:54,333
Say "Don't cry Tara"!

1352
01:52:58,792 --> 01:52:59,875
Say it!

1353
01:53:07,167 --> 01:53:08,250
Don't cry, Tara.

1354
01:53:15,292 --> 01:53:16,708
Okay, darling.

1355
01:53:27,583 --> 01:53:29,208
Here-here-here-here... come.

1356
01:53:35,083 --> 01:53:35,875
Thank you.

1357
01:53:59,083 --> 01:54:00,208
Hey...

1358
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:28,292
Say something.

1359
01:54:30,458 --> 01:54:33,125
I am drunk... I'll say the truth.

1360
01:54:38,458 --> 01:54:39,542
Then spill it out.

1361
01:54:42,417 --> 01:54:44,042
What do you really want now?

1362
01:54:47,542 --> 01:54:48,458
Right now...

1363
01:54:48,667 --> 01:54:55,667
I want a tender... hot... eggs on toast.

1364
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:06,917
Hmmm... me too.

1365
01:55:17,917 --> 01:55:20,958
Take that chain off...
- Why?

1366
01:55:21,625 --> 01:55:23,167
Take it off... or I'll snatch it.

1367
01:55:45,708 --> 01:55:47,583
So how many days is that worth?

1368
01:55:50,625 --> 01:55:51,542
Tara!

1369
01:55:53,958 --> 01:55:57,667
You want me to keep it
with me and always miss you.

1370
01:55:59,458 --> 01:56:03,541
No. I want to keep
that with me always...

1371
01:56:03,542 --> 01:56:06,625
...so I can smile when I think of you.

1372
01:56:07,208 --> 01:56:07,917
Okay-

1373
01:56:40,458 --> 01:56:44,833
I wonder what the kids
do out there until midnight.

1374
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:50,167
What kids? We don't have kids.

1375
01:56:50,875 --> 01:56:52,958
You do have one... Paplu.

1376
01:56:55,458 --> 01:56:58,208
And dinner?
- We already ate.

1377
01:56:58,667 --> 01:57:01,457
Now we'll eat tomorrow...
with the kids.

1378
01:57:01,458 --> 01:57:05,208
On our 'Golden Anniversary'.

1379
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,167
That's what I've been doing.

1380
01:57:16,750 --> 01:57:17,958
Show off.

1381
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:29,917
Why is the door open?

1382
01:57:32,125 --> 01:57:34,875
Happy anniversary guys.

1383
01:57:36,917 --> 01:57:37,958
<i>Ac“ .</i>

1384
01:57:44,625 --> 01:57:46,875
Is the gas on? Take a look.

1385
01:57:48,333 --> 01:57:49,708
Gopi uncle.

1386
01:57:51,708 --> 01:57:53,083
Charu aunty.

1387
01:57:54,250 --> 01:57:55,625
It was on?
- Yeah.

1388
01:57:57,125 --> 01:57:58,125
Let's check upstairs.

1389
01:58:04,542 --> 01:58:05,625
Uncle.

1390
01:58:06,792 --> 01:58:08,167
I'm calling Gopi uncle.

1391
01:58:08,375 --> 01:58:09,500
Charu aunty.

1392
01:58:14,208 --> 01:58:15,083
His phone's right here.

1393
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:18,417
Something's wrong.

1394
01:58:19,167 --> 01:58:20,042
Hemu.

1395
01:58:21,208 --> 01:58:22,458
Give me the car keys.

1396
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:23,708
Where are uncle and aunty?

1397
01:58:23,709 --> 01:58:25,207
I was coming over to give the keys...

1398
01:58:25,208 --> 01:58:27,292
...when I learned that madam walked out.

1399
01:58:27,542 --> 01:58:28,582
It's been over 30 minutes.

1400
01:58:28,583 --> 01:58:30,666
And sir is already
out looking for her.

1401
01:58:30,667 --> 01:58:32,624
Here's the key.
- This is uncle's phone.

1402
01:58:32,625 --> 01:58:33,874
Call me if you find out anything.
- Okay.

1403
01:58:33,875 --> 01:58:34,625
Come on.

1404
01:58:34,626 --> 01:58:36,125
Be careful.
- Yeah.

1405
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:39,083
Let's go.

1406
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:05,833
Stop. Stop.
- What?

1407
01:59:06,542 --> 01:59:09,042
Charu Aunty.
- That's not her.

1408
01:59:14,042 --> 01:59:15,333
It's completely our fault.

1409
01:59:15,917 --> 01:59:18,375
We should've convinced
uncle to hire a nurse.

1410
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:19,999
Aunty was always clear about that...

1411
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,208
Only uncle will take care of her.

1412
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:22,625
Of course she will say that.

1413
01:59:23,958 --> 01:59:25,875
Will uncle listen
to you or Charu aunty?

1414
01:59:30,875 --> 01:59:32,250
Which way should we go now?

1415
01:59:33,917 --> 01:59:35,875
Wait... I'll go take a look.

1416
01:59:36,125 --> 01:59:36,917
On the temple road.

1417
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,542
Adi, stop.
- Keep seated, I'll go take a look.

1418
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:41,833
Don't yell at me.

1419
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:44,583
Don't turn off the engine,
and don't go anywhere.

1420
01:59:58,375 --> 01:59:59,583
Charu aunty!

1421
02:00:13,458 --> 02:00:14,583
She isn't there.

1422
02:00:20,417 --> 02:00:22,332
Don't you see the 'No-Parking' board?

1423
02:00:22,333 --> 02:00:24,374
Why park your car here?
- Sir, my wife's missing.

1424
02:00:24,375 --> 02:00:26,582
What do I do?
- Come on, show me your license.

1425
02:00:26,583 --> 02:00:28,332
Let me go, sir...
- Come on...

1426
02:00:28,333 --> 02:00:30,833
Get out... get out now...
- I am going!

1427
02:01:21,792 --> 02:01:22,833
It's locked.

1428
02:01:26,708 --> 02:01:27,625
Where were you?

1429
02:01:28,458 --> 02:01:29,583
I was checking in the market.

1430
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:31,292
I told you to stay in the car!

1431
02:01:32,542 --> 02:01:35,500
Why? Only you can go
look for Charu aunty, not me?

1432
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:36,792
What if she was in the market?

1433
02:01:37,458 --> 02:01:38,541
Couldn't you wait for me?

1434
02:01:38,542 --> 02:01:41,125
You left the car
there... and a cop showed up.

1435
02:01:42,042 --> 02:01:45,250
You can't handle a cop,
but you can yell on me.

1436
02:01:47,125 --> 02:01:49,249
Take a left here... up
ahead... the hospital road.

1437
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:51,083
It's a one way... we'll get in trouble.

1438
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:54,166
Then go around.
- I am... l am...

1439
02:01:54,167 --> 02:01:55,250
Stop bothering me.

1440
02:01:57,917 --> 02:02:00,167
If you're so fed-up,
why don't you just leave me?

1441
02:02:02,667 --> 02:02:04,082
I am leaving you forever!

1442
02:02:04,083 --> 02:02:05,417
I'm going to America.

1443
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:07,458
Isn't that what you want?

1444
02:02:12,417 --> 02:02:14,250
Adi... Gopi uncle!

1445
02:02:15,167 --> 02:02:16,750
What is this? You want to die?

1446
02:02:17,417 --> 02:02:18,958
Tara! Tara!

1447
02:02:19,167 --> 02:02:20,917
Gopi uncle! - Are you crazy?
Do you have a death wish?

1448
02:02:21,417 --> 02:02:22,042
Hey...

1449
02:02:22,583 --> 02:02:24,541
Wait there... I'll handle you.
Handle your wife first...

1450
02:02:24,542 --> 02:02:25,708
Handle your wife first...

1451
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,750
Come on... come you rascal...

1452
02:02:28,083 --> 02:02:29,375
Where are you going?

1453
02:02:29,708 --> 02:02:33,917
Gopi uncle! Gopi uncle! Gopi uncle!

1454
02:02:34,625 --> 02:02:36,875
Gopi uncle! Gopi uncle!

1455
02:02:38,583 --> 02:02:40,708
Gopi uncle! Gopi uncle!

1456
02:02:42,042 --> 02:02:42,917
Gopi uncle!

1457
02:02:55,708 --> 02:02:58,999
Come on. - You can't
just jump out of a moving car.

1458
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,667
Should I jump in front of a car too?

1459
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:04,083
What did you see?

1460
02:03:04,917 --> 02:03:07,375
That man... he looked
just like Gopi uncle!

1461
02:03:14,208 --> 02:03:15,500
What if he had hit you?

1462
02:03:18,167 --> 02:03:19,125
But he did.

1463
02:03:19,333 --> 02:03:22,250
What if he had? What then?

1464
02:03:23,292 --> 02:03:25,666
If you care so much for me,
why are you yelling?

1465
02:03:25,667 --> 02:03:26,833
I am not yelling!

1466
02:03:47,125 --> 02:03:48,458
Poor Gopi uncle.

1467
02:03:50,792 --> 02:03:53,292
No one can be as caring as him.

1468
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:56,958
That's not true.

1469
02:04:00,583 --> 02:04:03,125
You think only uncle
can take care of aunty.

1470
02:04:03,708 --> 02:04:05,500
No one else can do the same.

1471
02:04:12,625 --> 02:04:14,417
Are you talking about yourself?

1472
02:04:24,208 --> 02:04:29,417
What if end up like aunty,
will you look after me?

1473
02:04:33,625 --> 02:04:34,833
Yes, I will.

1474
02:04:40,125 --> 02:04:45,625
If I get lost...
will you come looking for me?

1475
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:53,250
I will.

1476
02:05:03,417 --> 02:05:04,666
You can go to Paris or anywhere...

1477
02:05:04,667 --> 02:05:05,708
...just marry me before you do.

1478
02:05:23,625 --> 02:05:24,792
Charu aunty!

1479
02:05:35,583 --> 02:05:36,583
Tara!

1480
02:05:39,375 --> 02:05:40,208
Come on.

1481
02:05:52,417 --> 02:05:54,333
Charu aunty! Charu aunty!

1482
02:06:02,458 --> 02:06:03,958
Charu aunty, are you okay?

1483
02:06:04,583 --> 02:06:06,000
Paplu?
- Paplu's at home.

1484
02:06:06,417 --> 02:06:07,667
Paplu's at home.
- He's at home.

1485
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:10,417
Let's go home,

1486
02:06:10,418 --> 02:06:11,500
Come, let's go home.

1487
02:06:11,958 --> 02:06:13,875
Charu aunty. Let's go home.

1488
02:06:40,042 --> 02:06:40,917
Paplu.

1489
02:06:47,042 --> 02:06:48,500
Come... come... come inside.

1490
02:06:50,208 --> 02:06:54,582
Thank God I found you Paplu,
or you would've been lost.

1491
02:06:54,583 --> 02:06:55,750
Then what about me?

1492
02:06:56,083 --> 02:06:58,583
I am sorry, Baby... very sorry.

1493
02:06:59,083 --> 02:07:00,542
It won't happen again.

1494
02:07:43,958 --> 02:07:47,083
You said something... in the car.

1495
02:07:48,917 --> 02:07:49,917
It was true.

1496
02:07:56,708 --> 02:07:59,458
The last six months were
the best days of our lives.

1497
02:08:01,333 --> 02:08:03,250
Imagine what our entire life can be.

1498
02:08:06,792 --> 02:08:08,833
You can go anywhere you like,
just marry me before you do.

1499
02:08:11,833 --> 02:08:13,250
We'll figure out the rest.

1500
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:23,750
Marriage?

1501
02:08:28,875 --> 02:08:29,750
Okay-

1502
02:08:37,042 --> 02:08:38,625
Marriage is for fools.

1503
02:08:41,250 --> 02:08:42,708
So let's be fools.

1504
02:08:47,208 --> 02:08:48,167
Okay, darling?

1505
02:08:50,542 --> 02:08:51,500
Okay, darling?

1506
02:08:53,042 --> 02:08:54,042
Okay, darling...
