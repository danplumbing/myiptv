one after the other.

22
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,555
And they brought me a drink
in a coconut.

23
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,554
And as they served me the drink, they
brushed their tits across my face.

181
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,676
The red light blinks,
you go through the door.

182
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,512
That's all
you've gotta remember. Right?

183
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,193
Light. Door.

184
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,834
Light. Door.

185
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,991
Light. Door. Oi!

186
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,669
Right. And don't
take your eyes off the light

187
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,512
and don't let me down.

188
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,193
Georgie?
Yes, Bart.

189
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,157
Hang that up there.
What, up there?

190
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,509
Come here.

191
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,075
Au right.

192
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,716
The light, Danny. The light.

193
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,435
Red means go. Right?

194
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,869
(PLAYS NOTE)

195
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,355
(GROANING)

196
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,589
(GASPS)

197
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,719
Sounds like someone in here
could use my help.

198
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,995
(LAUGHS)

199
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,399
Hi. How you doing?

200
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,199
I'm just gonna tune these pianos.
Probably be a couple of hours.

201
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,314
If you don't mind.

202
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,515
(PLAYING)

203
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,198
You like pianos?

204
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,636
Yeah, me, too. Of course, you know,
this whole place is like a...

205
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,071
It's like
a big treasure chest.

206
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,834
Probably gonna be a whole month getting
all these ladies back into health.

207
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,273
You know, tuning pianos
is really hard work,

208
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,670
and my back
isn't what it used to be.

209
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,036
Are you doing
anything important right now?

210
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,112
'Cause I could really use a hand here.
How about it?

211
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,275
Please.

212
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,352
Are you still there?

213
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,352
You are, aren't you?

214
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,115
Yes..

215
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,110
Good. Good.

216
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,514
Come on.

217
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,676
You know, a lot of people think because
a piano's so big, it is very strong,

218
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,878
and you can just pound on it any way
you want to and nothing will happen.

219
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,157
But that's not so at all.
Pianos are a lot like people.

220
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,671
I mean, you pound on a person,
they get out of tune.

221
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,519
Same with a piano.

222
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,358
You pound on them and...

223
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,157
Oh, Lordy, listen to that.
Huh? Sad as a baby crying.

224
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,990
I'll tell you
what I want you to do now.

225
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,113
When I say press, I want you
to press on these keys.

226
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,714
Starting with this one right
here and going to the right.

227
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,714
One, then two, then three.

228
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,199
Think you can do that?

229
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,669
Okay. Put your hand here,
just like that.

230
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,349
All right?

231
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,999
Oh! Oh!

232
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,397
Oh, my goodness!
Oh. Wait a minute.

233
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,472
Loosen up.
Loosen up. That's it.

234
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,599
Music's got to flow from within, you know.
Can't flow if you're all stiff.

235
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,034
On the key there.

236
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,634
Just relax.

237
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,433
Nothing to be afraid of.

238
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,070
And there we are.
Are you ready?

239
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,672
And press.

240
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,039
A little harder.

241
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,998
Good. Again. Good.

242
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,879
Listen, you show a real talent
for this sort of work.

243
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,596
Okay, press it again. Press.

244
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,077
Oh, wonderful.
And one more time.

245
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,075
Ready?

246
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,353
Press. Press.

247
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,829
Go ahead. Relax.
Let the energy flow.

248
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,993
Let the magic happen!
Good. Good. Good. Good.

249
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,551
Excellent. Excellent.

250
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,553
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

251
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,310
Now,

252
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,400
you want to see what you did?

253
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,915
Yes..

254
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,229
Check this out.

255
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,358
Is that the sweetest
sound or what?

256
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,514
Yes..

257
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,039
Want to try it?

258
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,517
Here, go on.
Put your hand here.

259
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,479
Put your fingers right there,
there and there.

260
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,435
Hit it.

261
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,078
Next stop, Carnegie Hall!

262
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,597
You know about Carnegie Hall?

263
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,751
It's this big place
in New York City.

264
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,117
All the great musicians
want to play Carnegie Hail.

265
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,914
I did, too.

266
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,273
When I was growing up,
it was my big ambition.

267
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,710
But I never was
that good a musician.

268
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,674
Are you okay?

269
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,750
Yes..

270
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,036
Good. What's your name?

271
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,590
Okay, all right, all right.
Mr. No-Name.

272
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,554
My name is Sam.

273
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,679
Pleased to meet you.

274
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,795
Me, too.

275
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,398
Good. That's good.

276
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,150
So, tell me something,
Mr. No-Name.

277
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,154
I've been hearing
this sort of clicking sound.

278
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,799
Do you hear it?

279
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,838
Or is it just...

280
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,229
(GRUNTING)

281
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,832
I'm gonna sell you
is what I'm gonna do!

282
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,357
If you can't do what I've trained you
to do, what fucking use are you?

283
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,513
No fucking use is the answer.
No fucking use at all.

284
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,916
I feed you. I clothe you!

285
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,872
I put a roof over your head.

286
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,516
And all that time I put in!
All the fucking effort

287
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,154
to make you
the man that you are.

288
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,800
And what gratitude
do I get? Look at me!

289
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,191
I look as if I've just been through
the third fucking world war.

290
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,635
Take him downstairs.
Get him out of my sight.

291
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,996
Come on, doggy. Come on.

292
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,878
I'm getting
too old for this shit.

293
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,797
Go on then, Danny. Get in.

294
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,075
Get in!
(COUGHS)

295
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,959
I'm busy.
I said get in there.

296
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,953
There's a man here to see you.
I just told you I'm busy.

297
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,634
He says he's got
a business proposition for us.

298
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,189
He says it's about
the show you put on today.

299
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,237
Pat him down.
Already did.

300
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,992
All right. Wheel him in.

301
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,152
Fucking visitors, looking like this.
It's a joke.

302
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,439
Shit! Jesus! Fucking he!!!

303
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,634
Leave us.

304
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,115
I'm listening.

305
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,280
That was a very impressive display your
man put on in the jewelry shop today.

306
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,636
I assure you,
it was entirely justified.

307
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,359
I'm sure it was.

308
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,756
That thing with the collar,
brilliant.

309
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,877
And the point
of this conversation is?

310
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,676
The point of this conversation is I'd like
to offer you a lucrative proposition.

311
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,194
How lucrative?

312
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,873
Very lucrative.

313
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,109
Should I continue?

314
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,510
Please.

315
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,111
MAN CONTINUES: It's an entertainment I
produce for some friends once a month.

316
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,998
Members only, so to speak.

317
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,275
What?

318
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,398
We're always on
the lookout for new talent.

319
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,189
The first fight is a tryout.
For that you get 15, 000.

320
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,914
For the second,
20 plus the right to bet.

321
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,514
We had one chap who, after
fees and betting on himself

322
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,637
got up to
half a million a fight.

323
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,870
That's only if you win,
of course.

324
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,431
BART: Well, how do you
get to win?

325
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,352
MAN: it's to the death.

326
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,472
So glad you could make it.

327
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,993
Please, follow me.

328
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,230
Where's the money?

329
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,994
Oh, well,
the money comes after.

330
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,869
After what?

331
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,839
After you beat him,
our current champion.

332
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,389
Undefeated in 15 bouts.

(YELLING)

334
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,079
Would you care
for a glass of champagne?

335
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,753
We won't be here that long.

336
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,000
Kill him.

337
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,114
(YELLING)

338
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,875
Rip his fucking ass off.

340
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,551
That's my boy!

341

(ELEVATOR DINGS OPEN)

342
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,835
Thanks for the opportunity.

343
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,309
You're most welcome.
Very impressive.

344
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,914
That bit with the collar,
how did you do that?

345
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,957
Like my saint of a mum
used to say,

346
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,600
"Get them young and the
possibilities are endless."

347
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,591
I thought it was
the Jesuits who said that.

348
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,751
Aye. Probably got it
from my mum.

349
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,155
If you want us back,
you do know where to find me.

350
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,629
Oh, we certainly
want you back.

351
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,396
Only, if you could make it a little
more entertaining next time.

352
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,552
I'll see what I can do.

353
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,834
Here, remember I told you
about that dream I had?

354
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,718
What? The one with all
the birds in it? Yeah.

355
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,837
Yeah.
Well, I figured it all out.

No.

Freud was a genius.

something, it means something else.

she does that. How was it?

533
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,117
Wet.
But is that all?

534
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,635
Nice.

535
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,040
Wet. Nice.

536
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,630
Sounds like what a kiss ought to feel like.
Come on, we got a lot to do.

537
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,790
Hello, love.
Oh, good morning, Maddy.

538
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,393
Maddy runs the best supermarket
in all of Glasgow.

539
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,273
Maddy, this is Danny.
Hello, Danny.

540
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,158
He's a little shy.
Oh, I like my men to be shy.

541
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,311
Presents a challenge
for a girl.

542
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,870
I'm just gonna give him some of
the finer points of shopping.

543
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,359
Couldn't have
a better teacher.

544
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,959
Isn't that so?

545
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,959
My mother could take
two stones and a cup of water

546
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,190
and make a three-course meal.

547
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,196
As soon as I was old enough, she
gave me the secret of great cooking.

548
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,157
And now I'm gonna
teach it to you.

549
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,516
So, you ready to learn
the secret to great cooking?

550
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,796
Yes.
Okay, here it is.

551
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,673
Food talks.
Food talks?

552
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,714
You didn't know that,
did you?

553
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,115
No.

554
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,520
Food talks.

555
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,319
It will tell you
everything you need to know.

556
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,994
All you have to do
is learn the language.

557
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,476
Take this melon here
for instance now.

558
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,709
(TAPPING)

559
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,471
What do you think
that's saying?

562
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,231
Yeah. But it's also saying,
"I am ripe."

563
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,356
You know what ripe
means, don't you? No.

564
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,956
Ripe means sweet
and sweet means good.

565
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,557
The kiss was ripe.

566
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,509
Uh,no,no.

567
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,399
The kiss was sweet.
The melon is ripe.

568
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,556
But ripe means sweet.

569
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,519
Well, when you're
talking about food.

570
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,592
Kisses are nourishing in their
own way, but kisses are...

571
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,200
Kisses are complicated.

572
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,953
For now,
let's just stick to melons.

573
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,237
(INHALING DEEPLY)

574
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,789
Good bread is fresh.
Here, smell it. Fresh.

575
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,031
Fresh.
Fresh.

576
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,873
Good. All right.
Get some bread, Danny.

577
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,950
Okay, now comes
the hard part. Cooking.

578
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,951
Over there in that cabinet,
there's a large, round pot.

579
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,680
Would you get it for me? Okay.

580
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,749
Now, when we
cook the food,

581
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,990
it speaks to us
in another language,

582
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,799
which we listen to with
our tongues, by tasting.

583
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,920
Look at these beauties.

584
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,829
Yeah.

585
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,632
Now, you know you've got good sausage
when they're attached like this.

586
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,795
Hmm.

587
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,197
Found something, didn't you?
Now, let's see...

588
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,719
That's Victoria when
she was a little baby.

589
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,075
And that's Victoria
with her mom.

590
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,878
Her father
was my best friend.

591
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,236
He died before
Victoria was born.

592
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,035
Her mother was
my best friend, also.

593
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,630
So,

594
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,557
after he died,
she and I got married.

595
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,119
Then, there was
a car accident

596
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,192
when Victoria was
seven years old.

597
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,840
Her mother was killed,
and I lost my eyesight.

598
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,470
Victoria was left with me.

599
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,871
Funny how families
get made, isn't it?

600
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,559
You got family?

601
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,994
Don't know.

602
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,273
Well, you must have.
Everybody's got family somewhere.

603
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,559
I don't remember them.

604
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,513
Well, maybe
you will one day.

605
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,198
The pots are in there.

606
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,917
Earth to Danny.

607
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,469
Sam sent me.
All by yourself?

608
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,279
Wow, big day!
We should celebrate.

609
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,839
What's that?

610
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,839
"Celebrate"? It means we
should do something special.

611
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,678
Sam said right home.

612
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,109
Come on.

613
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,353
Here. Thank you. Come on.

614
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,319
This is the cone
and this is the ice cream.

615
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,790
You ever
have ice cream before?

616
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,474
No. Well, this is
vanilla ice cream.

617
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,273
Vanilla's white.

618
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,480
Vanilla is white.
Go on, taste it.

619
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,632
Oh, no.
Just work it around.

620
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,430
(SWALLOWS)

621
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,999
Oh, my God!

622
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,153
You know the thing about ice cream is
first it's cold, but then it's sweet.

623
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,871
And if you freeze your mouth out, you're
never gonna be able to taste the sweet part.

624
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,237
So look,
here's how you do it. You...

625
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,311
Sweet is good.
Yeah, right.

626
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,193
So look, you lick

627
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,280
like that.

628
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,479
There you go.

629
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,309
How's that?

630
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,352
Look.
You're getting it everywhere.

631
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,589
Shit. Actually,
we should really hurry.

632
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,000
Come on.

633
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,514
You okay?

634
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,359
Finish it quickly.

635
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,990
And remember, if Sam asks where we
were, you let me do the talking.

636
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,630
If he knows we had ice cream before dinner,
he'll be pissed we ruined our appetite.

637
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,074
Understand?

638
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,753
What's appetite?

639
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,514
Appetite's what you have if you don't
have a belly full of ice cream.

640
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,829
How's my mouth?

641
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,756
Nice.
No, it's not.

642
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,271
It's full of hardware,
but not for much longer.

643
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,558
Do you miss your mom?

644
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,394
Every day.

645
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,553
You miss your mom?

646
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,197
I don't remember my mom.

647
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,798
Sometimes I think it'd be
easier not to remember.

648
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,390
Hi.

649
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,635
Hi.

650
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,869
You're late.

651
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,715
It was so nice out we decided
to walk the long way.

652
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,393
Oh, you...

653
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,994
Didn't I say bring her
straight home?

654
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,589
Sam, it was me, not him.

655
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,909
Oh, it was...

656
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,077
If you wanted to take
the long way home, Victoria,

657
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,559
you could have gone
to that school in Kansas.

658
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,631
Then you could have taken
the long way home for 50 miles

659
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,518
and I wouldn't care!
50 miles of corn.

660
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,398
Corn is safe.
Corn is boring.

661
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,073
And anyway,
this was the better school.

662
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,790
Which is why we're here
and not with the corn, right?

663
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,518
So do me a favor.

664
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,189
Don't make me worry.

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,430

Vanilla is white.

Yeah?

Sometimes I worry
about that boy.

678
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,032
It's as if
something or someone

679
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,077
has made him shut down
his feelings so hard,

680
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,390
he can no longer
get in touch with them.

That's what I've been trying
to get him to do.

With vanilla ice cream?

683
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,671
Maybe we should come up with
some different strategies.

Night.

685

Notes.
Okay.

691
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,713
Notes are signals.

Notes are signals.

Notes are signals.

694
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,199
So if you see this note,

it's the signal
to play this key.

Danny, do you remember
when I said

722
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,159
that Victoria and I were not
big on asking questions?

723
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,278
That we thought when people were ready,
they'd give their own answers?

Well, after today

think I'm gonna get them

they were fighting.

732

Yes.

733
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,036
But that didn't bother you?
No.

734
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,872
You weren't afraid?
No.

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,351

in situations like that,

736
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,431
they get afraid.

They weren't fighting me.

you had an uncle.

an excellent piano player.

See?
"Mozart, Sonata Number 11. "

1083
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,753
Your mom didn't just play music,
she played beautiful music.

1084
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,513

but I really do need to know
where to find him.

1092
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,599
No, I've never
seen him before in my life.

1093
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,436
Let me rephrase the question.

1094
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,198
What is this?
Oh, Sam! Oh, Sam!

1095
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,159
He remembered. I was playing the
piano, the music, and he remembered.

1096
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,595
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Slow down, slow down. Remembered what?

1097
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,393
His mother.
Who killed his mother.

1098
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,630
You remember who killed your mother?
Sam, we have to go.
